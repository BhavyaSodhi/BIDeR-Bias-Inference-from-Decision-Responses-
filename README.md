# BIDeR(Bias-Inference-from-Decision-Responses)
BIDeR (Bias Inference from Decision Responses) is an AI system designed to uncover hidden biases in real-world decision-making systems such as college admissions, loan approvals, job shortlisting, or insurance evaluations. In many everyday systems, decisions significantly impact people’s lives, yet the reasoning behind acceptance or rejection is often unclear, and the governing rules remain hidden—even to system owners. While most AI solutions prioritize speed and accuracy, BIDeR focuses on fairness and transparency. It learns the implicit decision patterns of any system by analyzing its responses and infers underlying rules without requiring prior access to internal logic or historical datasets. The system identifies when, where, and how unfairness occurs, such as detecting if certain groups are systematically disadvantaged. By exposing invisible bias and generating clear analytical insights, BIDeR aims to make automated decision-making more transparent, accountable, and equitable.
